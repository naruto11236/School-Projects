    <p>aIf you weren't aware of who I was already, my name is Tyler Young
      and I will be attending Louisiana State University in the Fall!
      As you can see from the picture, I am in "Short shorts gang". I know
      you may be thinking, "I wish I could be in short shorts gang" but it's
      definitely not for everybody. This is usually for current or former basketball
      players that are elite at what they do on and off of the basketball court.</p>
